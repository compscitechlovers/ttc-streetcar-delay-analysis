#### Simulate ####

#### clean the data and only take the information we wish to use ####

#### Testing ####
# If there is TRUE outputting, then test is assumed to be passed
# All of the test are passing with return value of True
# For those with multiple data outputting, there might be some false outputing
# after the True value, those can be ignored because as long the first value
# is outputting True, then that means it is passing the test, since we are only
# checking for first value to be outputted as True in the data
simulated_delay_data$line |> unique() == c('Line 501')

# Checking if the first 2 routes matches the routes listed in the dataset
ttc_streetcar_clean$line |> unique() == c('504', '501')

# Checking if the day listed as first in dataset and clean file matches
ttc_streetcar_clean$day |> unique() == c('Saturday')

# Checking if this incident listed as first in dataset and clean file matches
ttc_streetcar_clean$incident |> unique() == c('Collision - TTC Involved')

# Checking if this incident listed as first in dataset and clean file matches
ttc_streetcar_clean$min_delay |> unique() == c('30')

# Checking if the min sample matches with total samples
ttc_streetcar_clean$min_delay|> min() <= 1

# Checking if the max sample matches with total samples
ttc_streetcar_clean$min_delay|> max() <= 17655

# Test that line data is a character
ttc_streetcar_clean$line |> class() == "numeric"

# Test that day data is a character
ttc_streetcar_clean$day |> class() == "character"

# Test that incident data is a character
ttc_streetcar_clean$incident |> class() == "character"

# Test that min_delay data is a number
ttc_streetcar_clean$min_delay |> class() == "numeric"
